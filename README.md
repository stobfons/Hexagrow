# Hexagrow
Game project by the team Ashly Fonseka, Jamila Grenzer and Jeremy Becker in the "game programming" module on behalf of the Anhalt University of Applied Sciences.
The game's concept is a drag-and-drop pathfinding game based on hexagons with different numbers of paths in increasingly complex levels. The goal during the semester is 2 or more test levels. Furthermore, a title animation, main menu, setting, shop and shop system in connection with another texture pack (music included).
